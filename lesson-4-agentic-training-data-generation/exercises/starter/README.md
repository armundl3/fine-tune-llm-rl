# Exercise: Building a Simple Clinical Agent

### Objective
Build a basic agent that can use tools and generate reasoning traces for the project scenario.

### Task
Build the agentic loop to generate and save reasoning traces using mock Python functions for get_comorbidities(patient_id) and verify_age(patient_id).

### Project Mapping
This lab is a direct, guided implementation of Phase 2: Agentic Trace Generation.
